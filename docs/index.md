## Play & program using µPython

µPython, or <a href="https://micropython.org/" target="_blank" alt="MicroPython documentation and site">**MicroPython**</a>, is an implementation of Python 3 optimized to run on microcontrollers, like the RP2040 in Thumby! MicroPython is a great way to get started with learning how to program, or to just quickly get a new game made on the Thumby. 

We created a [**Thumby MicroPython API**](/API/Get-Started/) (application programming interface), to make programming even easier! Using our all-in-one [**Web Browser IDE**](https://tinycircuits.github.io/) (integrated development environment), you are just a few tutorials away from creating your own Thumby program or game! The IDE also contains the Thumby Arcade where users publish their games for anyone to play and download to their own Thumby. 

Navigate to the [**Web IDE documentation**](/IDE/Get-Started/) to learn more.
