We house our own manufacturing operation in Akron, OH, where we assemble, test, and ship all of our products. 

TinyCircuits is a supporter of open-source hardware and software and believes collaboration leads to faster innovation. Our products are all open-source and released under the Creative Commons Share-Alike 3.0 License. We are a proud supporter of the Open Source Hardware Association and have helped sponsor the Open Hardware Summit since 2013.

Our mission is to make cool stuff!

If you want to help us build open source software, feel free to submit pull requests to any of our repositories on GitHub. If you want to update information or add tutorials to this website, you can submit tutorials at the Thumby Documentation site
